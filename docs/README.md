# Martabak Cult

## Gaming x DEFI x NFT x Martabak

The Martabak Cult is a cult that dedicates their lives to the Martabak God. Living on the Polygon blockchain as ERC721 NFTs. The cultâ€™s main goal is primarily to bring stability and happiness to each member through gaming, DEFI, and real-life benefits.

## Activation phase

In its initial phase, the Martabak Cult will give birth to 3200 NFTs with the ability to yield a token ($MTBK). These NFTs are divided into 3 different types:

|  Type   | Supply | $MTBK/day |
| :-----: | :----: | :-------: |
| Android |  1500  |    15     |
| Gynoid  |  1500  |    15     |
| Shaman  |  200   |    25     |

In addition, each NFT has the ability to get boosted and receive an extra 10 $MTBK daily. Boost can be acquired for 0.02 wETH during or after the minting phase and is attached for life to the NFT.

The yield is calculated for each droid a wallet owns and is attached to the droid itself until it is claimed by the owner. Meaning that if an NFT is transferred to another wallet, the current owner will lose the unclaimed $MTBK for the transferred token and the new owner will be able to claim those token. The yield is simply calculated from the last claimed block timestamp.

## Breeding phase

After the 3200 genesis NFTs are minted, breeding becomes available.
In order to breed, a wallet needs to own one Android and one Gynoid. The cost is 1500 $MTBK tokens.
A total of 6000 additional NFTs can be minted from breeding.

By default, a breed NFT does not yield any $MTBK. The only way for them to yield is to be activated through a boost (0.02 wETH). Similar to the genesis, boost enable the possibility to yield 10 $MTBK/day.

## Martabak token ($MTBK)

The Martabak token is the core utility token of the project. Used only for breeding during the initial phase of the project, it will play a central role in all future features such as DEFI and gaming.

The only way Martabak is minted is through the NFT.

**Initial mint:** 1,000,000 will be minted to the project wallet. This will only be used to gift the community through various events.

**$MTBK total supply:** 500,000,000

**$MTBK burned:** 9,000,000 will be burnt from breeding (1500 x 6000)

NFT holders will stop receiving $MTBK after the total supply is minted. When that happens, unclaimed tokens will be lost.

To give an idea of what it represents:

- Considering each NFT is not boosted it would take 10000 days to reach the max supply
- Considering each NFT is boosted it would take 3521 days to reach the max supply

## What's next

We do not wish to publish an insane roadmap just to show off. Instead we will orient the project in the way that the community wishes the most.

Decisions will be taken by voting on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/).

This document will be updated as it goes.
